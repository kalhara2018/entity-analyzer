# Preparing Your Data Files
* Inside the files folder, create text files for each competitor.
* Name these files sequentially starting from comp1.txt, comp2.txt, and so forth. For example, if you have six competitors, your files should be named comp1.txt, comp2.txt, ..., comp6.txt.
* Ensure each file contains the relevant data for its respective competitor. This data is what will be analyzed by the TextRazor API.
